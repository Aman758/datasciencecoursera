## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than 
# compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write 
# a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

#Write the following functions:

# makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
# inverse from the cache.

# Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, 
# then solve(X) returns its inverse.

# For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

# Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
